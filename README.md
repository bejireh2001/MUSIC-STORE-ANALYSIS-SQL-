# Digital Music Store Data Analysis (SQL)
# Project Overview
This project involves an end-to-end data analysis of a digital music store's playlist database using SQL. The primary objective was to help the music store understand its business growth by analyzing various aspects of sales, customer behavior, and music genres. This analysis provides actionable insights for strategic decision-making.

# Database Schema
The analysis is based on a relational database featuring the following interconnected tables:
- artist
- album
- track
- media type
- genre
- invoice line
- invoice
- customer
- employee
- playlist track

# SQL Techniques Demonstrated
This project showcases a comprehensive range of SQL skills, from basic querying to advanced analytical techniques:

- Basic SQL Queries: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT for data retrieval, filtering, and sorting.
- Joining Multiple Tables: Extensive use of JOIN clauses (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to combine data from various tables for complex analysis (e.g., connecting customer and invoice details, linking genre, track, album, and artist information).
- Aggregate Functions: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN to summarize and group data (e.g., total invoice amounts, number of invoices per country).
- Subqueries: Employed for more intricate data retrieval and filtering based on derived results (e.g., finding tracks longer than the average song length).
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs): Utilized for structuring complex queries, improving readability and maintainability (e.g., determining the most popular music genre per country, identifying top customers per country).

# Key Analysis Examples
The project addressed various business questions, including:

- Identifying the senior-most employee.
- Determining countries with the most invoices and top total invoice values.
- Finding the city and customer with the highest spending.
- Listing rock music listeners and identifying top rock artists.
- Analyzing track lengths relative to the average.
- Calculating customer spending on specific artists.
- Identifying the most popular music genre for each country.
- Identifying the top customer for each country based on spending.

# Skills Gained
This project significantly enhanced skills in:

- Data Extraction & Manipulation: Efficiently retrieving and transforming data using SQL.
- Data Analysis & Pattern Identification: Uncovering trends, anomalies, and valuable insights from large datasets.
- Data-Driven Decision Making: Formulating observations and recommendations based on analytical findings.
- Problem-Solving: Applying structured querying to answer complex business questions.
# How to Run
1. Clone the repository: git clone [your-repo-link]
2. Database Setup:
-(Instructions on setting up the database, e.g., "Install SQLite" or "Set up PostgreSQL.")
-(Instructions on importing the dataset, e.g., "Import chinook.db into your SQL client.")
3. Run Queries:
- Navigate to the sql_queries directory.
- Execute the .sql files in your preferred SQL client.
